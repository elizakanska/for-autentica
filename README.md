I accidentally forgot to make the github repo first and ended up struggling with git later. All the files were manually uploaded as a result, since I couldn't get git to ignore certain classes and folders. I am being up-front about this because this was a serious oversight and this was the first time ignoring the order of repo->local development burnt me this hard, this will never happen again.
